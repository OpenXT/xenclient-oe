#@DESCRIPTION: Machine configuration for OpenXT installer

# The OCAML layer will not work for this machine on a i.86 HOST.
# ocaml-cross-x86_64:do_configure will use OCAML ./configure script which will
# use gcc-cross-x86_64 to build samples in order to probe for compiler
# capabilities (see config/auto-aux/runtest in ocaml sources).
# This will to run on the jessie i686 build environment recommended for OpenXT
# as there is no /lib/ld-linux.so.2 capable of running x86_64 programs (attemps
# will fail with `No such file or directory').
