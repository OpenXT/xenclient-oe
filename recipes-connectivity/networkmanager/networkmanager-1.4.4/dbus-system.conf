OpenXT:

network-manager-applet (nm-applet) now uses GDBus, this changes how it authenticates over tcp (in our case argo).
Below config allows nm-applet (running in uivm) to connect to ndvm dbus.

GDBus, while connecting over network (argo) only provides two authentication mechanisms:
	1. DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1
	2. ANONYMOUS

DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1: This requires access to some file in ndvm for successful authentication.
Hence using ANONYMOUS method which doesn't perform any authentication.
