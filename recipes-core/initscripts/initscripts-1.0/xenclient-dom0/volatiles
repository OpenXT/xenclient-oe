# This configuration file lists filesystem objects that should get verified
# during startup and be created if missing.
#
# Every line must either be a comment starting with #
# or a definition of format:
# <type> <owner> <group> <mode> <path> <linksource>
# where the items are separated by whitespace !
#
# <type> : d|f|l : (d)irectory|(f)ile|(l)ink
#
# A linking example:
# l root root 0777 /var/test /tmp/testfile
# f root root 0644 /var/test none
#
# Understanding links:
# When populate-volatile is to verify/create a directory or file, it will first
# check it's existence. If a link is found to exist in the place of the target,
# the path of the target is replaced with the target the link points to.
# Thus, if a link is in the place to be verified, the object will be created
# in the place the link points to instead.
# This explains the order of "link before object" as in the example above, where
# a link will be created at /var/test pointing to /tmp/testfile and due to this
# link the file defined as /var/test will actually be created as /tmp/testfile.
