CA-297688, CA-293634: Keep caching enabled during SEC phase

This eventually slows down UEFI guest booting significantly
on Intel with PCI passthrough and on AMD all the time.

On AMD there is no other way to avoid having caches disabled
at this point except to keep it enabled in guest itself
(since we cannot keep caching enabled in the hypervisor
on AMD while code is executed exactly in OVMF high region).

This alone doesn't fix Intel case as guest MTRRs are implemented
in Xen for this platform and architectually guest CR0.CD doesn't
affect guest caching (it's specifically emulated in Xen with
guest PAT).

For Intel case, temporary remove all variable MTRRs that might
cover areas of memory SEC phase is operating on during FV
decompression (which results in a lot of back-to-back memory
operations) and make sure they are WB. Restore previous
MTRR state right before jumping into PEI Core which is located
in low memory and should be WB already.
