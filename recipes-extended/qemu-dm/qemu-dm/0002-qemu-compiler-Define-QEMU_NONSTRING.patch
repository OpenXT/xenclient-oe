Subject: [PATCH 02/17] qemu/compiler: Define QEMU_NONSTRING
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

GCC 8 introduced the -Wstringop-truncation checker to detect truncation by
the strncat and strncpy functions (closely related to -Wstringop-overflow,
which detect buffer overflow by string-modifying functions declared in
<string.h>).

In tandem of -Wstringop-truncation, the "nonstring" attribute was added:

  The nonstring variable attribute specifies that an object or member
  declaration with type array of char, signed char, or unsigned char,
  or pointer to such a type is intended to store character arrays that
  do not necessarily contain a terminating NUL. This is useful in detecting
  uses of such arrays or pointers with functions that expect NUL-terminated
  strings, and to avoid warnings when such an array or pointer is used as
  an argument to a bounded string manipulation function such as strncpy.

  From the GCC manual: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Variable-Attributes.html#index-nonstring-variable-attribute

Add the QEMU_NONSTRING macro which checks if the compiler supports this
attribute.
