Subject: [PATCH] Add thorough reset interface to pciback's sysfs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHORT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adds an interface that allows "more thorough" resets to be performed
on devices which don't support Function Level Resets (FLRs). This
interface should allow the toolstack to ensure that a PCI device is in a
known state prior to passing it through to a VM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LONG DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk's original post to xen-devel and the LKML:

  The life-cycle of a PCI device in Xen pciback is complex
  and is constrained by the PCI generic locking mechanism.

  It starts with the device being binded to us - for which
  we do a device function reset (and done via SysFS
  so the PCI lock is held)

  If the device is unbinded from us - we also do a function
  reset (also done via SysFS so the PCI lock is held).

  If the device is un-assigned from a guest - we do a function
  reset (no PCI lock).

  All on the individual PCI function level (so bus:device:function).

  Unfortunatly a function reset is not adequate for certain
  PCIe devices. The reset for an individual PCI function "means
  device must support FLR (PCIe or AF), PM reset on D3hot->D0
  device specific reset, or be a singleton device on a bus
  a secondary bus reset.  FLR does not have widespread support,
  reset is not very reliable, and bus topology is dictated by the
  and device design.  We need to provide a means for a user to
  a bus reset in cases where the existing mechanisms are not
   or not reliable. " (Adam Williamson, 'vfio-pci: PCI hot reset
  interface' commit 8b27ee60bfd6bbb84d2df28fa706c5c5081066ca).

  As such to do a slot or a bus reset is we need another mechanism.
  This is not exposed SysFS as there is no good way of exposing
  a bus topology there.

  This is due to the complexity - we MUST know that the different
  functions off a PCIe device are not in use by other drivers, or
  if they are in use (say one of them is assigned to a guest
  and the other is idle) - it is still OK to reset the slot
  (assuming both of them are owned by Xen pciback).

  This patch does that by doing an slot or bus reset (if
  slot not supported) if all of the functions of a PCIe
  device belong to Xen PCIback. We do not care if the device is
  in-use as we depend on the toolstack to be aware of this -
  however if it is we will WARN the user.

  Due to the complexity with the PCI lock we cannot do
  the reset when a device is binded ('echo $BDF > bind')
  or when unbinded ('echo $BDF > unbind') as the pci_[slot|bus]_reset
  also take the same lock resulting in a dead-lock.

  Putting the reset function in a workqueue or thread
  won't work either - as we have to do the reset function
  outside the 'unbind' context (it holds the PCI lock).
  But once you 'unbind' a device the device is no longer
  under the ownership of Xen pciback and the pci_set_drvdata
  has been reset so we cannot use a thread for this.

  Instead of doing all this complex dance, we depend on the toolstack
  doing the right thing. As such implement [... a SysFS attribute]
  which [... the toolstack]  uses when a device is detached or attached
  from/to a guest. It bypasses the need to worry about the PCI lock.

  To not inadvertly do a bus reset that would affect devices that
  are in use by other drivers (other than Xen pciback) prior
  to the reset we check that all of the devices under the bridge
  are owned by Xen pciback. If they are not we do not do
  the bus (or slot) reset.

  We also warn the user if the device is in use - but still
  continue with the reset. This should not happen as the toolstack
  also does the check.

--

Our version of the patch has been modified to use a less confusing
sysfs name. The original name ('do_flr') is inappropriate, as it
implies a function level reset; it is entirely possible that the patch
code will use a bus-level reset when appropriate.

The new sysfs entry is located at:

  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pciback/reset_device

and can be activated by writing a domain:bus:device:function device
identifier into the sysfs file. As an example:

  echo "0000:01:00.0" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pciback/reset_device

would reset the device matching the D:BDF descriptor above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGELOG:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a port of a patch that likely had many authors, including:
    -Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk
    -Alex Williamson
    -Ross Phillipson <rphilipson@ainfosec.com>
Ported to OpenXT by: Kyle J. Temkin <temkink@ainfosec.com>, 4/8/15
Rewrite by:          Kyle J. Temkin <temkink@ainfosec.com>, 4/10/15

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch requires ONE of the following:
  -A relatively modern linux kernel (3.18+) as a base; which provides
   the PCI functions used; or
  -Our PCI reset backports patch (backport-pci-reset-functionality.patch),
   which backports the relevant functionality to 3.11.

To take advantage of this patch, the utilized toolstack should be
changed to:
  -Use the provided "reset_device" property, rather than the PCI
   device's sysfs "reset" entry. This enables resets beyond a FLR to be
   used.
  -Ensure that all functions of a given device are passed through
   together. This allows us to use some of the more thorugh resetting
   techniques, when possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMOVAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This patch provides a service which is necessary for proper passthrough
of many PCI cards: a generalized ability to reset PCI devices, without
requiring that the device support FLR or power-management based resets.

This patch will be necessary until either the Linux PCI subsystem or Xen
PCIback drivers are modified to provide this support; or until cards
without proper FLR support are no longer supported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPSTREAM PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is taken from a patch which was originally proposed and
rejected from upstream on the LKML and xen-devel. An upstream
implementation of the functionality of this patch is still necessary;
and can and should be implemented.

This patch will hopefully be replaced with an upstream version when
community concensus has produced a single "blessed" method of
accomplishing its functionality.
