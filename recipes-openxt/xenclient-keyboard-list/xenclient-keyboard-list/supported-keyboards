# List of supported keyboard layouts for XenClient.
#
# The complete list of keyboard layouts and variants is available in the
# xkeyboard-config package - see the file /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst
# in the UIVM filesystem.
#
# The first column should be in the form "LAYOUT" or "LAYOUT-VARIANT". The
# second column is optional. If present, it will override the keyboard layout
# name from xkeyboard-config.
