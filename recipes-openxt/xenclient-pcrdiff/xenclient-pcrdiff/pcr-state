NOTE:
Change messages for PCRs 0-3  are derrived from section
3.2.3 of the document titled "TCG PC Client Specific
Implementation Specification For Conventional BIOS".
A copy of this document can be obtained from the TCG
website.

Change messages for PCRs 17-19 are derrived from the
documentation provided in the tboot source tree and
the document titled "Intel® Trusted Execution Technology
(Intel® TXT) Measured Launched Environment Developer’s
Guide".  A copy of this document can be obtained from
the Intel website.

Please consult these documents for details on the
contents of each PCR and the impact a change in these
values may have on your system.
