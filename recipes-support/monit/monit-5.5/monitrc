## Below you will find examples of some frequently used statements. For 
## information about the control file and a complete list of statements and 
## options, please have a look in the Monit manual.

## Global section
###############################################################################
##
## Start Monit in the background (run as a daemon):

set daemon 6                # check services at 6-second intervals
with start delay 12         # optional: delay the first check by 4-minutes (by 
                            # default Monit check immediately after Monit start)


## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, Monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to 
## a standalone log file instead, specify the full path to the log file

set logfile syslog facility log_daemon                       


## Set the location of the Monit id file which stores the unique id for the
## Monit instance. The id is generated and stored on first Monit start. By 
## default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.id.
#
# set idfile /var/.monit.id
#
## Set the location of the Monit state file which saves monitoring states
## on each cycle. By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.state. If
## the state file is stored on a persistent filesystem, Monit will recover
## the monitoring state across reboots. If it is on temporary filesystem, the
## state will be lost on reboot which may be convenient in some situations.
#
set statefile /tmp/.monit.state
#
## By default Monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available. 
# nice, as we don't want any e-mail alerts


## Monit has an embedded web server which can be used to view status of 
## services monitored and manage services from a web interface. See the
## Monit Wiki if you want to enable SSL for the web server. 

# if there is no port set, HTTP access will be disabled. 
# for local PXE installations it will be set through the answer file
#set httpd port 2812
#    use address 127.0.0.1  # only accept connection from localhost
#    allow 127.0.0.1        # allow localhost to connect to the server, needed to run local monit commands!
#    allow admin:monit      # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
#    allow @root           # allow users of group 'monit' to connect (rw)
#    allow @users readonly  # allow users of group 'users' to connect readonly

## Services
###############################################################################
##
## Check general system resources such as load average, cpu and memory
## usage. Each test specifies a resource, conditions and the action to be
## performed should a test fail.
#
#  check system myhost.mydomain.tld
#    if loadavg (1min) > 4 then alert
#    if loadavg (5min) > 2 then alert
#    if memory usage > 75% then alert
#    if swap usage > 25% then alert
#    if cpu usage (user) > 70% then alert
#    if cpu usage (system) > 30% then alert
#    if cpu usage (wait) > 20% then alert
#
#    
## Check if a file exists, checksum, permissions, uid and gid. In addition
## to alert recipients in the global section, customized alert can be sent to 
## additional recipients by specifying a local alert handler. The service may 
## be grouped using the GROUP option. More than one group can be specified by
## repeating the 'group name' statement.
#    
#  check file apache_bin with path /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
#    if failed checksum and 
#       expect the sum 8f7f419955cefa0b33a2ba316cba3659 then unmonitor
#    if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
#    if failed uid root then unmonitor
#    if failed gid root then unmonitor
#    alert security@foo.bar on {
#           checksum, permission, uid, gid, unmonitor
#        } with the mail-format { subject: Alarm! }
#    group server
#
#    
## Check that a process is running, in this case Apache, and that it respond
## to HTTP and HTTPS requests. Check its resource usage such as cpu and memory,
## and number of children. If the process is not running, Monit will restart 
## it by default. In case the service is restarted very often and the 
## problem remains, it is possible to disable monitoring using the TIMEOUT
## statement. This service depends on another service (apache_bin) which
## is defined above.
#    
#  check process apache with pidfile /usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid
#    start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start" with timeout 60 seconds

#    if cpu > 60% for 2 cycles then alert
#    if cpu > 80% for 5 cycles then restart
