# This recipe is a mess:
#
# 1) it uses precompiled binaries
# 2) it compies those binaries into the source tree
# 3) it can't run the compile step twice
# 4) the install step has unexpected dependancies on the source code
# 5) the output depends on the installed platform java, not on a java
#    interpreter managed by the build system
# 6) this recipe has the wrong name - it should match the new name of the repo
#
# why isn't the rpc generation part of the source's build makefile/script
# it's clearly not part of a configuration script.
